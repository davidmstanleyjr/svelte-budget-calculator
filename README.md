# svelte-budget-calculator

I did this cool project because I wanted to sharpen my Javascript skills and also because I wanted to learn this Javascript framework i've been hearing about called Svelte.JS. I enjoyed working in Svelte very much. It's very robust yet less complicated than other JS frameworks. It reminds me of a cross between handlebars and React.

# Environment Setup

1. Clone my repo at https://github.com/davidmstanleyjr/svelte-budget-calculator

2. CD into it and run "npm install" to install all of the dependencies.

# Technologies Used
1. HTML
2. CSS 
3. Javascript
4. Svelte

# Issues
This project was both fun and challenging. It was complicated to use the correct syntax so that my Javascript would work within Svelte. However, once I got used to it, it wasn't very complicated at all. 

The modal transitions and animations were difficult to figure out at first but they work really well and I don't know that React has anything similar that allows you to add modals and transitions directly through a div.

The functionality to switch between "add expense" and "edit expense" on screen depending on state was kind of hard but I figured it out.

Also getting the form to show only when clicked was complicated to figure out at first with Svelte but I was able to do it.
